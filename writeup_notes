LeNet defaults: 0.89 accuracy
Grayscale: 0.89

0.0001 learning rate, 30 epochs: 0.868


Things to try:
 * create fake images with modified contrast
 * create fake images with modified brightness
 * change the stride
 * change the kernel
 * duplicate images for under-represented labels to have the same number of images per label
 * preprocess to grayscale
 * reduce learning rate
 * run for 100x epochs
 * increase parameters (underfitting?)
 * decrease parameters (overfitting?)
 * add dropout
 * add regularization
 * make deeper
 * add 1x1 convolution for non-linearity
 * read http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf and apply some of their techniques
 * increase batch size by 10xs
